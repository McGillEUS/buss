            BUSS would like to ensure that incoming students are able to have
            all their questions answered, and to get some tips and guidance while
            they navigate their first year. Run by the VP Administration &
            Engagement, the BUSS Buddy Program, our mentorship program, pairs up
            incoming students with current bioengineering students so that they
            have a friend going in that can help them through the process!

            The Bioengineering Undergraduate Student Society (BUSS) is a student
            organization which serves to represent all undergraduate students in
            the Department of Bioengineering at McGill University. BUSS is
            dedicated to providing academic and social opportunities to inspire,
            entertain, and guide its members through their undergraduate degree.
            All BUSS Council positions are elected in the Winter Semester,
            excluding the U0 and U1 Representatives which are selected by the
            Selection Committee in September.

            Chaired by the Vice-President Academic, the Academic Committee
            consists of students from all years that work to bridge the gap
            between students and the department. Their main goal is to
            communicate with bioengineering professors and administration,
            giving them feedback and suggestions for courses, as well as help 
            resolve any academic issues students may have with courses. The
            Academic Committee also works to promote the research occurring
            within bioengineering labs. They will often host various workshops
            and seminars that help expose students to the great work being done
            in academia and industry!

            Chaired by the Vice-President Administration & Engagement, the
            First-Year Committee is a group of U0 and U1 students that work
            together to host events and create initiatives specifically for
            first-years. FYC often hosts two events per semester and works
            together to create a strong and welcoming community for newly
            admitted students! This is a great way for first-year students to
            become involved.

            McGill BioDesign is an Engineering Undergraduate Society design team
            whose goal is to address real world issues by finding solutions at
            the intersection of engineering, biology, and business. We work on
            biotechnology projects to present at competitions and give research
            experience to students, provide a community for like-minded students
            from a range of backgrounds, and offer networking and professional
            development opportunities through workshops and tutorials.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
Take off slider from the beginning (turtles slide)
Make the two gallery albums into sliders instead
Make the buss logo at the top corner slightly smaller (along with the title)
Fix the alignment issue for the headshots with “meet the team”
Horizontal scroll because the background is too wide
